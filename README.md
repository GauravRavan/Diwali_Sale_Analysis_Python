# Diwali Sale Analysis using Python

This project provides an in-depth analysis of Diwali sale data, exploring various customer trends such as spending habits based on gender, region, zone, and product category. The analysis was conducted in **Jupyter Notebook** using **Pandas** for data handling, along with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizations.

## Project Overview
The project follows a step-by-step approach:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Loaded and cleaned the `.csv` file to prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted analyses on various aspects:
   - **Gender-based Analysis**: Examined spending patterns by gender.
   - **Regional Analysis**: Analyzed spending across different states and regions.
   - **Zone Analysis**: Observed spending trends in specific zones.
   - **Product Category Analysis**: Assessed popular product categories, such as food, clothing, and electronics.

## Visualizations
- **Libraries Used**: The analysis includes visualizations created using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**.
- **Visual Approach**: Each aspect of the analysis is represented visually with clear, descriptive graphs that offer insights into the spending patterns and trends in the dataset.

## Files
- **Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis with code, visualizations, and interpretations.
- **Diwali Sales Data.csv**: The dataset used in this analysis, included in the repository for ease of use.
